# Age and Physical Activity Status of Australian Volunteer Firefighters: A Cross-sectional Study

Objectives: The study aimed to 1) determine the age distribution of Australian volunteer firefighters; 2) estimate the proportion of volunteer firefighters who met the Australian physical activity guidelines, using population data as a comparator; and 3) investigate the effects of age on physical activity and exercise in volunteer firefighters.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was electronically distributed to Rural Fire Service volunteers, in Queensland Australia. The survey included demographic, anthropometric and service questions, in addition to physical activity questions from the 2016â€“2018 Australian National Health Survey. The Australian guidelines were used to determine whether respondents met the national recommendations for weekly physical activity and exercise only minutes, and strength-based training days. Bayesian generalized linear regression models were used to determine the effect of age on weekly physical activity and exercise only minutes.

Results: A total of 480 volunteers responded. The mean age was 51.4 years (95% bootstrap confidence interval = 50.0 to 52.8). Compared to the Australian population, volunteer firefighters were over four times more likely to meet the physical activity guidelines, and the exercise only guidelines; but 1.4 times more likely to not meet the strength-based activity guidelines. Physical activity minutes declined with age, by on average 60 minutes each decade. Age had no effect on weekly exercise only minutes.

Conclusions: Volunteers were more likely to meet the national physical activity and exercise only guidelines, but less likely to meet the strength-based training guidelines compared to population. Volunteer firefighters could benefit from outreach programs that promote participation in strength-based training.
